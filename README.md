# TFG_UB_GCNNfor3DRegistration
This is my final tesis in the degree of Computer Engineering, coursed in Universitat de Barcelona:
Graph Convolutional Networks for 3D garment registration.

The registration of a 3D mesh consists of, given two 3D objects, establishing a correspondence
vector for each vertex of one mesh with one of the second one. This process can be
used to obtain realistic simulations. Specifically, in this project, I will build the registration
of pieces of clothing on realistic models of human bodies. To do so, I will implement
an unsupervised machine learning model, using Graph Convolutional Networks, which
allow working with non-euclidean data structures, such as 3D objects. This could allow
us to build in a fast and efficient way the registration of the garments.
